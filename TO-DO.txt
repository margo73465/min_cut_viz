TO-DO:

Do-able:
x figure out why last node doesn't disappear
x figure out how to draw edges so they don't overlap
- highlight edge to be deleted, highlight nodes to be smashed
- transition to show smashing
- appropriate edge(s) turns into self-loop, disappears
- newly created node fades to look like the rest of them 

Hard:
- add a click feature that causes collapsed nodes to spring back out
- color nodes based on min-cut (partition into 2 groups, cluster)
- highlight all edges that would have to be cut for a particular min cut

Other:
x generate a random graph to do min-cut algorithm on
- go back to college notes and figure out a deterministic min-cut algorithm
- fix your dang code for the actual algorithm so that it really works
	- optimize for speed
