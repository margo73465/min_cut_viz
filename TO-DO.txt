TO-DO:

Do-able:
x figure out why last node doesn't disappear
- figure out how to draw edges so they don't overlap
- highlight edge to be deleted, highlight nodes to be smashed, highlight newly created node

Hard:
- add a click feature that causes collapsed nodes to spring back out
- color nodes based on min-cut (partition into 2 groups, cluster)
- highlight all edges that would have to be cut for a particular min cut

Other:
x generate a random graph to do min-cut algorithm on
- go back to college notes and figure out a deterministic min-cut algorithm
